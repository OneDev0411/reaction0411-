## [v0.0.19] (https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-cfs-tempstore/tree/v0.0.19)
#### 08/04/14 by Eric Dobbertin
- use internal tracking collection

- Have TempStore set the size

## [v0.0.18] (https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-cfs-tempstore/tree/v0.0.18)
#### 06/04/14 by Eric Dobbertin
- delete chunkCount and chunkSize props from fileObj after upload is complete

## [v0.0.17] (https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-cfs-tempstore/tree/v0.0.17)
#### 06/04/14 by Eric Dobbertin
- We now wait to mount storage until it's needed (first upload begins); this ensures that we are able to accurately check for the cfs-worker package, which loads after this one. It also makes the code a bit cleaner.

## [v0.0.16] (https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-cfs-tempstore/tree/v0.0.16)
#### 04/04/14 by Morten Henriksen
- Temporary workaround: We currently we generate a mongoId if gridFS is used for TempStore

- Note: At the moment tempStore will only use gridfs if no filesystem is installed

## [v0.0.15] (https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-cfs-tempstore/tree/v0.0.15)
#### 02/04/14 by Morten Henriksen
- Use the stored event and object instead (result object is not used at the moment - but we could store an id at some point)

#### 31/03/14 by Eric Dobbertin
