## Don't crowd the UI. 
Dialogs should be constructed with at least 30% (preferably 100%) expansion room in mind. If this becomes impossible, a second dialog or a tabbed interface must be implemented.

## Use ToolTips. 
All buttons / icons should use ToolTips and/or status bar messages (if possible)

##Write in complete sentences. 
String resources should be composed of complete sentences or phrases; concatenated strings should be minimized.

##Comment your resources. 
Include comments in your resource files (if possible), especially for unusual terms or phrases, for resources that must not be translated, or for resources which must only be translated in a particular way.
