#Installation

Developers can easily install, and modify Reaction locally.

##Prerequisites
OS X: Install [git](https://github.com/blog/1510-installing-git-from-github-for-mac) command line and [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

##Installation
    curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
    sudo -H npm install -g meteorite
    git clone https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction.git
    cd reaction
    mrt update
	

##Startup
To just start the app, without any preset configurations run the meteor command:

	meteor

or to run with settings/dev.json
	
	./bin/run

or run with specific settings just add --settings settings/yoursettings.json

To reset data and give you a fresh test dataset from the reaction-commerce packages private/data

	./bin/reset
	

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see Reaction running (sample data same as on demo site)

The initial admin user for the site is auto generated, and displayed in your console (or see: env variables section to default these)

*Note: Optionally you can run and reset with "meteor" and "meteor reset", but you will not load settings data from configuration files. You would need to save them in your data, or create your own private/data*

##Deploying
An example of a deployment with password to a [meteor.com hosted site](http://docs.meteor.com/#deploying) using config from settings/prod.json

	meteor deploy --settings settings/prod.json yourdemosite.meteor.com

## Configuration Files (optional)
If you will be doing any development or deployment, it's best to configure a configuration file so you aren't typing all your account information in every time you do "meteor reset"

Create [settings/dev.json](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction/blob/master/settings/dev.sample.json) and populate, or copy dev.sample.json (will work with empty configuration values)

	cp settings/dev.sample.json settings/dev.json

Example configuration file

	{
	  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
	  "googleAnalyticsProperty": "__KEY__",
	  "facebook": {
	    "secret": "__SECRET__"
	  },
	  "public": {
	    "isDebug": true,
	    "facebook": {
	      "appId": "__APP_ID__"
	    }
	  }
	}

### Env variables (optional)

	export MAIL_URL="<smtp connection string"
	export METEOR_EMAIL="youradmin@yourdomain.com" 
	export METEOR_USER="admin"
	export METEOR_AUTH="password"
	export MONGO_URL="<your mongodb connect string>"

The METEOR_EMAIL, METEOR_USER, METEOR_AUTH will create this user/pass/email as the default first site admin user.

### Email 
To send email you need configure the [env MAIL_URL variable](http://docs.meteor.com/#email_send

Password reset, and a few other items that use email templates won't work unless you configure this.


#Dockerfile

The Dockerfile creates a Docker image of a production version of the application, that has been demeteorized and is ready to run Reaction in a Node.js production environment app container. It does not include a database (hint: mongohq.com is a great place to get a free test db)

You can pull our latest build from the [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ongoworks/reaction/),  or from the Reaction directory you can just do:

	docker build ongoworks/reaction .


Typically you would start a Docker/Reaction app container by starting the Docker image like this:

docker run -i -t -e MONGO_URL="<your mongodb url>" -e ROOT_URL="http://localhost" -e PORT="8080" -p ::8080 -d ongoworks/reaction
