###Code Style
Suggest that when building packages you include (.editorconfig)[https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction/blob/master/.editorconfig]

Recommended indentation style is 2 spaces.

#### event,template
When using event, template parameters in methods, use full names

	'click': (event,template) ->

#### return
As much as possible, include the `return` keyword in all functions. Include it alone if you want to return `undefined` since coffeescript will otherwise try to return some other value, and it may not
be what you expect or want. Using explicit `return` also makes the code more readable for others.

### console.log
Feel free to have verbose console.logs in the code, but use the following format to not clutter production logging:

```
console.log "Something we want to see during development" if Meteor.settings.public?.isDebug
```
