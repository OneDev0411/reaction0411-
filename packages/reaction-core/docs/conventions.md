###Code Style Guide
In general we try to align with the [Meteor style guide](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Style-Guide).

#### event,template
When using event, template parameters in methods, use full names

	'click': (event,template) ->

#### return
As much as possible, include the `return` keyword in all functions. Include it alone if you want to return `undefined` since coffeescript will otherwise try to return some other value, and it may not be what you expect or want. Using explicit `return` also makes the code more readable for others.

### console.log
Feel free to have verbose console.logs in the code, but use the following format to not clutter production logging:

```
console.log "Something we want to see during development" if Meteor.settings.public?.isDebug
```


#Server layer
	
	functionalMethod *try to follow functional, action*
	functionalAddItem *example*

#Variable Scope & Namespaces

*common/packageGlobals.js:*

```js
// exported
ReactionCore = {};
ReactionCore.Collections = {};
ReactionCore.Helpers = {};
ReactionCore.Packages = {};
```

*common/collections.coffee:*

```coffee
Product = ReactionCore.Collections.Product = new Mongo.Collection("Product")
# etc...
```

*anyfile.coffee:*

```coffee
# If we're going to use Product collection in this file, which could be in core or in an add-on pkg,
# we can optionally assign to a file-scope variable at the top of the file to keep our code short.
Product = ReactionCore.Collections.Product
# etc...
# At some point, in some file, we eventually define all the variables from packageGlobals.js
helperOne = ->
  return true
```

And the core pkg exports only `ReactionCore`, on both client and server:

```js
api.export(["ReactionCore"]);
```
