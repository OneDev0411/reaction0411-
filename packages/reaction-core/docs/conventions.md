##Conventions
This entire doc is really just a bunch of stuff you'll probably need to know, or at least reference to contribute successfully to Reaction development.

Our core is being built with a preference for Coffeescript + LESS, but JavaScript is welcome in packages. [There has been some discussion about moving to ES6.](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/320)

##Issues
For development tasks/issues please use the [Reaction project issues](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction/issues?state=open). We're keeping this as the central issue tracking for all [reactioncommerce:*](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/) packages. You can also view issues on our [waffle board](https://waffle.io/reactioncommerce/reaction).

The default branch for reaction, reaction-core, reaction-core-theme is *development*. Pull requests made into the *development* branch, will be reviewed and accepted into development for a quick release, while we work on specific feature branches separately, to be merged into *development*.

We're trying to practice the art of liberally creating issues for every development task, rather than just 'community' bugs. This can be much noisier but we're trying to ensure we're publicly capturing and sharing all the tasks so everyone can have detailed insight into the project progress.

The [help wanted](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/labels/help%20wanted) label calls out issues that prioritize where community member contributions would be relatively easy. Of course, all contributions are welcome.

The [ready](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/labels/ready) label groups issues that can be worked on immediately; requirements documentation should be complete (work to do on this). If you want to take ownership of one these [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/reactioncommerce/reaction.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/reactioncommerce/reaction) issues, self assign it and change to "in progress" label when the item is actually being worked on, or comment in the issue.

Of course, [in progress](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/labels/in%20progress) labels are actively being worked on.

##Releases
We will publish packages, and merge `development` into `master`, whenever a major feature set becomes test-able.

No pull requests to `master` will be accepted.

`master` should always be a stable branch, but with a rapid merge cycle from `development`.  The [release](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/releases) and published packages will be tagged for minor release or higher, and sometimes for special case patches.

###Testing
We're testing a couple of [Velocity packages](http://velocity.meteor.com/).

See: https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/241

* Feature branches can be merged and released when they are feature incomplete, but soon we're planning on enforcing a passing test written for every pull request.*

##Pull Requests

**Caution: your own research may be needed here, feedback is appreciated!**

Please make sure your pull requests are to the active `development` branch, no pull requests to `master` will be accepted. When you create a pull request, you can click the 'edit' button to change the "to" branch.

Please cleanup your PR into as few commits as possible (single is good).

In your branch:

```bash
git rebase -i origin/development
```


In the editor that opens, replace the words "pick" with "squash" next to the commits you want to squash into the commit before it(so all but the first one, for a single commit). Save and close the editor, and another editor instance will open the combined commit messages, tidy them up and save and close the editor.

If you need to edit the commit message later you can use

 ```bash
 git commit --amend
 ```

You can now `push` your branch to GitHub. If you've already published this branch, you should create a new branch, or use `--force` (rewrites history)

```bash
git push --force
```

Finally, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) into the `development` branch of the appropriate reaction package.

##Style Guide

*A work in progress, but these are good guides.*

Read [Meteor Style Guide](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Style-Guide) for ideas on format and style of contributions.

Generally, follow the [CoffeeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide) as well.


**event,template**

When using event, template parameters in methods, use full names

  'click': (event, template) ->

**return**

As much as possible, include the `return` keyword in all functions. Include it alone if you want to return `undefined` since coffeescript will otherwise try to return some other value, and it may not be what you expect or want. Using explicit `return` also makes the code more readable for others.

**comments**
Use of `{{!-- comment --}}` rather than `<!-- comment -->` is suggested, this isn't outputed in production.

##Server Methods

###Variable Scope & Namespaces

*common/packageGlobals.js:*

```js
// exported, global/window scope
ReactionCore = {};
ReactionCore.Schemas = {}; // Schemas defined in common/schemas
ReactionCore.Collections = {}; //Collections defined in common/collections
ReactionCore.Helpers = {}; //Misc.helpers defined in common/helpers
ReactionCore.MetaData = {}; // SEO, Metadata object
ReactionCore.Locale = {}; //i18n translation object
ReactionCore.Events = {}; // Logger instantiation (server)
```

*common/collections/collections.coffee:*

```coffee
Product = ReactionCore.Collections.Product = new Mongo.Collection("Product")
# etc...
```

*anyfile.coffee:*

```coffee
# If we're going to use Product collection in this file, which could be in core or in an add-on pkg,
# we can optionally assign to a file-scope variable at the top of the file to keep our code short.
Product = ReactionCore.Collections.Product
# etc...
# At some point, in some file, we eventually define all the variables from packageGlobals.js
helperOne = ->
  return true
```

The `reaction-core` package exports `ReactionCore`, on both client and server:

```js
api.export(["ReactionCore"]);
```

###Logging
We use Bunyan for server logging https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan. Client logging is standard Meteor client handling of `console.log`.

The ongoworks:bunyan package exports `loggers`, and is instantiated by the `ReactionCore.Events` global that can be used anywhere in Reaction code.

To enable logging set/add `isDebug: true` in `settings.json`.  Value can be any valid `bunyan level` in settings.json, or true/false.

Setting a level of *debug*  `isDebug:  "debug"` or higher will display verbose logs as JSON. The JSON format is also the storage / display format for production.

*Recommend running meteor with `--raw-log` to remove Meteor's default console formatting. This is the default when you use `./bin/run` to start Meteor.*

Feel free to include verbose logging, but follow [Bunyan recommendations on log levels](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#levels) and use appropriate levels for your messages.


```
The log levels in bunyan are as follows. The level descriptions are best practice opinions.

"fatal" (60): The service/app is going to stop or become unusable now. An operator should definitely look into this soon.
"error" (50): Fatal for a particular request, but the service/app continues servicing other requests. An operator should look at this soon(ish).
"warn" (40): A note on something that should probably be looked at by an operator eventually.
"info" (30): Detail on regular operation.
"debug" (20): Anything else, i.e. too verbose to be included in "info" level.
"trace" (10): Logging from external libraries used by your app or very detailed application logging.
Suggestions: Use "debug" sparingly. Information that will be useful to debug errors post mortem should usually be included in "info" messages if it's generally relevant or else with the corresponding "error" event. Don't rely on spewing mostly irrelevant debug messages all the time and sifting through them when an error occurs.
```

Example:
```

ReactionCore.Events.info "Something we want to see during development"

```
