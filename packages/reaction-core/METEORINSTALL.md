Start with a meteor project

	mrt create "mytestshop"


# Bare bones
	
	meteor remove insecure
	meteor remove autopublish
	mrt add bootstrap3-less
	mrt add reaction-commerce



You should be able to verify package is installed and running at

http://localhost:3000/dashboard


For now, you can edit shop db and add an owner id to the shops collection (from Meteor.userId()),
or be signed in before to site. 

Coming soon a site creation walkthrough.
