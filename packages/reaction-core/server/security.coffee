# The following security definitions use the ongoworks:security package.
# Rules within a single chain stack with AND relationship. Multiple
# chains for the same collection stack with OR relationship.
# See https://github.com/ongoworks/meteor-security
#
# It's important to note that these security rules are for inserts,
# updates, and removes initiated from untrusted (client) code.
# Thus there may be other actions that certain roles are allowed to
# take, but they do not necessarily need to be listed here if the
# database operation is executed in a server method.
