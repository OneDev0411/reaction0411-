Reaction Core provides a core set of methods and templates for creating, connecting, and managing user carts, sessions, products, checkout and orders for Reaction Commerce.

```
meteor add reactioncommerce:core
```

If this is a newly created Meteor project:

```
meteor remove insecure
meteor remove autopublish
meteor add nemo64:bootstrap
meteor add reactioncommerce:bootstrap-theme
meteor add reactioncommerce:reaction-accounts
```

Create [client/themes/bootstrap/custom.reaction.json](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/blob/master/client/themes/bootstrap/custom.reaction.json) and [client/themes/bootstrap/custom.bootstrap.json](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/blob/master/client/themes/bootstrap/custom.bootstrap.json). These files configure the default LESS theme.

```
mkdir -p client/themes/bootstrap
curl -o client/themes/bootstrap/custom.bootstrap.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/master/client/themes/bootstrap/custom.bootstrap.json
curl -o client/themes/bootstrap/custom.reaction.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/master/client/themes/bootstrap/custom.reaction.json
```
