See [Meteor Docs](http://docs.meteor.com) for introduction to [Meteor](http://meteor.com).

Read [Meteor Style Guide](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Style-Guide) for format and style of contributions.

Our core is being built with a preference for Coffeescript + LESS, but JavaScript is welcome in packages.

We try to always be using latest full release of all community packages.
