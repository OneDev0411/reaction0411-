# Reaction Analytics
This package is currently working but feature incomplete. Pull requests to the development branch are appreciated.

This provides an analytics framework for integrating third-party analytics services such as [segment.io](segment.io), [Google Analytics](google.com/analytics), and [Mixpanel](mixpanel.com).

This package will only send analytics libraries to the client that you have enabled, and it is easily extensible to add additional analytics libraries as you need.

Because Meteor restricts packages' build plugin access to assets, we have to work around by requiring the additional `reactioncommerce:reaction-analytics-libs` package where the analytics source files are kept.

## Installation
1. `meteor add reactioncommerce:reaction-analytics`
2. create empty `custom.analytics.json` file someone where in your project. ( Such as: `/client/analytics/custom.analytics.json`)
3. Edit `custom.analytics.json` to enable or disable analytics libraries that you use.

## Defaults
You must create a file named `custom.analytics.json` to enable this package, if you leave it empty, the following settings will be used:

```JSON
{"libs": {
  "segmentio":          true,
  "googleAnalytics":    false,
  "mixpanel":           false
}}
```

### Thanks
This package is a contribution of [https://github.com/spencern](https://github.com/spencern), and has been forked for maintenance ease. The version that Reaction uses is published as `reactioncommerce:reaction-analytics`.

Thanks to [Nemo64](https://github.com/Nemo64) for his [meteor-bootstrap](https://github.com/Nemo64/meteor-bootstrap) package which showed me how to work around the build package limitations.

Example use:

```
<a href="{{pathForSEO 'product' 'handle'}}" data-event-category="grid" data-event-action="product-click" data-event-label="Grid product click" data-event-product="{{_id}}">
```

Stores event tracking data in ReactionAnalytics collection.
