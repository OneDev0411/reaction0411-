Router for Reaction Commerce

```
meteor add reactioncommerce:reaction-router
```

This package provides a routing package (iron-router) wrapped for ReactionCommerce.

Goals:
- migrate from iron:router to flow-router
- smooth transitions
- Reaction packages use the ReactionRegistry to declare routes.
- Wrap as Router as "ReactionRouter"
