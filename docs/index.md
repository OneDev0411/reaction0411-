#Introduction

Reaction Commerce is built by  [Ongo Works](http://ongoworks.com). It is an open source ecommerce platform developed on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and the [Meteor](http://meteor.com) framework.  Reaction provides a lightweight, reactive commerce platform with a goal of simplifing and aligning the user experience to the admin experience. 


``` Selling online should be as easy as shopping online.```


This documentation provides an overview of the features of Reaction, and it will answer questions about how to use Reaction as a shop owner. There is also a section for developers, which helps a developer or designer quickly start using the platform locally where they can contribute changes to the project, or fork the project and modify to suit any requirement.

This documentation is part of the project pages, which you can browse at [GitHub](http://github.com/ongoworks/)

Documentation includes existing features, marked with a Reaction release version number, but also describes features that are under development. If the feature is under development, there will be an associated link to an issue page on GitHub. You are encouraged to contribute ideas, feedback and questions on the [issues page](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction/issues?state=open). For general discussion and support check out our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reaction-talk).
