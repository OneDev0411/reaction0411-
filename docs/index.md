#Introduction

Reaction Commerce is an open source ecommerce platform developed on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and the [Meteor](http://meteor.com) framework.  Reaction provides a lightweight, reactive commerce platform with a goal of simplifing and aligning the user experience to the admin experience.  
``` Adding a product should be a simple as buying a product.```

This documentation provides an overview of the features of Reaction, and will answer questions about how to use Reaction as a shop owner. There is also a section for developers, which can get a developer or designer quickly using the platform where they can easily make modifications.

This documentation is part of the project pages, which you can browse at [Github](http://github.com/ongoworks/)

Documentation includes existing features, marked with a Reaction release version number, but also describes features that are under development. If the feature is under development, there will be an associated link to an issue page on Github. You are encouraged to contribute ideas, feedback and questions on the [issues](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction/issues?state=open) page.
