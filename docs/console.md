##Console

The Console is where you can view contextual analytics and statistics for your shop. To access your Console you must be logged in. Click on your avatar in the upper right corner of the page; then from the dropdown menu select Console.

Once your Console is enabled, you will notice a third navigation row on your shop that includes Dashboard, Orders, and Members:

To open your Console drawer, click on the two down arrows shown here:

When your Console is open, it appears like a "drawer" that now follows you around as you navigate through your shop. You can close the Console by clicking on the double arrows. You can remove the Console by clicking on the "x" icon. Our vision is to offer contextual analytics via the Console as you navigate throughout your shop.

### Console > Orders

Currently, the Console is empty, except for on the Orders page:

The Console > Orders drawer shows two analytics cards. 

* The first card displays the number of orders in your shop in any state other than completed. The circle will change from green to red depending on the aging of the uncompleted orders in your shop. 
* The second card displays 4 circle graphs: Pending, Packing, Processing, and Completed with a number in the circle representing the numbers of orders in that particular state. The circles change color from green to red depending on the aging of the orders in that particular state.
