## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Reaction production ready?

No, not yet. We're currently in our Alpha preview release. Our [Vision page](https://reactioncommerce.com/vision) outlines what we have in store for our Beta release, which is when we'll be production ready. We are targeting Beta for early 2015.

### What's your roadmap for Reaction?

Our [Vision page](https://reactioncommerce.com/vision) outlines our roadmap and plans for Reaction.

### Do you offer hosted shops?

Yes, when you create a shop on our platform at [reactioncommerce.com](https://reactioncommerce.com), this launches a shop running the most current version of Reaction and runs it on Docker, via Amazon EC2, with its own MongoHQ-powered database. Keep in mind that shops that are created during our Alpha release aren't guaranteed to always be up and running. If your shop becomes inactive, you can visit your Control Panel and click the Restart button to get it going again.

### Is it possible for me to host a Reaction shop anywhere I want?

Yes, you can host a Reaction shop on any host / virtual machine container that supports Meteor/Node.js and MongoDB. Our code is fully open source on GitHub at: [github.com/ongoworks/reaction](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction).

### Do you support multiple languages?

Yes. We recently launched [internationaltization support](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction-core/blob/master/docs/i18n.md) for 15 languages and we will be adding in additional coverage and localization soon.

### What is the pricing/licensing model?

Reaction Commerce is currently free and there will always be a free, open source version available. Eventually, we will offer premium plans with tiered pricing structures on the reactioncommerce.com platform. Our code is licensed under the GPL v3 license. The Terms & Conditions for shops hosted on our reactioncommerce.com platform can be found at [https://reactioncommerce.com/terms](https://reactioncommerce.com/terms).
