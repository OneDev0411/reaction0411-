##Dashboard

The Dashboard is the brain center for your shop: The place where you can access Settings, manage Orders, view and install Apps, manage Admin Access, and otherwise oversee your shop. To access your Dashboard you must be logged in. Click on your avatar in the upper right corner of the page, and a window will open where you can choose to view the Dashboard.

###Settings

"Settings" is located in the first card of your Dashboard drawer. Click the "cog" icon (![](http://raw.github.com/ongoworks/reaction/master/docs/assets/guide-icon-cog.png)) next to it to access your "Shop Settings" screen. The "General" tab will open, and you can change your Shop Name and Email address. Under the "Address" tab you will need to fill out your company information. The "SMTP" tab and the "Settings" tab allow you to configure email and domains for your shop.

###Admin Access

The Access page is found by clicking the "cog" icon (![](http://raw.github.com/ongoworks/reaction/master/docs/assets/guide-icon-cog.png)) next to "Admin Access" in your Dashboard drawer. This is where you can give your staff members access to administer your Reaction site.


###App Gallery

Clicking on the Shop link under the Dashboard drawer opens the App Gallery. You can view and configure apps such as PayPal and Google Analytics. Each individual app card has its own "cog" icon (![](http://raw.github.com/ongoworks/reaction/master/docs/assets/guide-icon-cog-lg.png)) to view and change your settings. To install an app, click the "plus" icon (![](http://raw.github.com/ongoworks/reaction/master/docs/assets/guide-icon-plus-square.png)); to uninstall an app, click the "checkmark" icon (![](http://raw.github.com/ongoworks/reaction/master/docs/assets/guide-icon-check-square.png)).

###Orders

The Orders page is found by clicking the "Orders" link under the Dashboard drawer. This is where you can view and process your orders.
