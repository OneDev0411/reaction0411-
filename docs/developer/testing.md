# Testing
We're using the Meteor testing framework [Velocity](//velocity.meteor.com/). Velocity allows us to use different testing approaches as needed.  Currently we're using [Jasmine](//github.com/Sanjo/meteor-jasmine) for the majority of tests.

Velocity doesn't always make it easy to test packages separately from the app. Velocity can also slow down the reload process during development while it's running tests in multiple cloned instances of the shop.

You can also test individual packages.

```
VELOCITY_TEST_PACKAGES=1 meteor test-packages --driver-package velocity:html-reporter package-to-test
```

As such, our testing falls into two locations:

## Reaction End to End Tests
   Located in the `reaction/tests/jasmine/client/integration` folder, these tests cover UIX testing. These are relatively fragile tests as they are only testing core theme and UIX.

   You enable these tests by uncommenting the velocity testing packages in `.meteor/packages`.

## Package integration Tests
   Tests for the individual reaction packages, are respectively located in `/tests/jasmine/server/integration`. Each package should cover tests  these tests cover UIX testing. These are relatively fragile tests as they are only testing core theme and UIX.

   These tests are run independently from the end to end tests, and can be run from the command line:

   `VELOCITY_TEST_PACKAGES=1 meteor test-packages --driver-package velocity:html-reporter package-to-test`

   To continuously test changes to the `core` package while using Reaction End to End tests simultaneously on another port:

```
   VELOCITY_TEST_PACKAGES=1 meteor test-packages --port 3006 reactioncommerce:core
```

Some Velocity setup tips:
- Uncomment `sanjo:jasmine` and the other testing packages found in the `/.meteor/packages` file in the Reaction path to use the browser testing console.
- You can set your `NODE_ENV` environment variable to 'development' to open up ports that velocity uses. The easiest way to do this is to run `export NODE_ENV="development"` before you start `meteor`
- If you run `meteor --test` your tests will only run once and will not re-run when you update files.

We'd like for new features to include at least basic integration test-coverage. If you are unsure about how to do this just ask and, we can point you in the right direction.
- Feature branches can be merged and released when they are feature incomplete, but soon we're planning on enforcing a passing test written for every pull request.*

_Writing tests is a great way to get to know the codebase a little better too._

[We've got an open issue on testing where any problems you run into while testing can go for now.](//github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/241)
