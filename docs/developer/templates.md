# Templates
To add or change features, or make non CSS layout updates you can create your own templates. [Iron Router](//github.com/EventedMind/iron-router) manages paths, layouts, and which templates load where.

Review the [Iron Router docs](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router/blob/devel/DOCS.md) for background information, then reference the file [_packages/reaction-core/common/routing.js](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-core/blob/master/common/routing.js). Here you will be able to see how all the default routes, paths, and template layouts are configured.

## Extending and customizing templates
To extend and customize the html for any reaction/meteor template, add a template extension map to `client/templates.coffee`

```javascript
# extending core with template extensions
Template.my_custom_template.replaces("core_template_name")
```

then create a template (probably a copy of the one you are extending).

```
<template name="my_custom_template">
    <h1>This will be used instead of the core template!</h1>
</template>
```

While you can always organize your templates however you wish, [we suggest](//github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-core/blob/master/docs/conventions.md) you mirror the existing structure. For example, if you are extending the template located in `packages/reaction-core/client/templates/products/products.html` then you would mirror that by creating your new template at `reaction/client/templates/products/myTemplate.html`

_The template helpers, events, etc. from the original are still accessible and used in the new extended template._
