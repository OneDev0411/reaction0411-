#Apps / Packages

`Reaction Apps` are the heart of Reaction Commerce. You can increase the power of your shop by adding and configuring additional `Reaction Apps`.

To access the Reaction Apps, login as an admin, navigate to your Dashboard, and click on the `Reaction Apps`link.

Developers can also create packages. [See developer documentation.](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-core/blob/master/docs/packages.md)
