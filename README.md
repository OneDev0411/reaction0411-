Reaction is a modern reactive, real-time event driven ecommerce platform.

Reaction is built with JavaScript (ES6), Meteor, Node.js and works nicely with Docker.

## Installation

**_reaction-cli installation_**

```bash
npm install -g reaction-cli
reaction init
cd reaction
reaction
```

> **reaction-cli** requires a recent version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```
npm i -g n
n stable
```

[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php) is optional, but required for transforming images for responsive sizing.

**Windows** users should review the [Windows specific installation requirements for Meteor and Reaction](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/development/requirements).

Additional setup options, such as how to set the default credentials, installation without `reaction-cli`, and [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) installation can be found in the [installation](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/development/installation) and [configuration documentation](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/development/configuration).

## Docs

Installation, configuration and development documentation is available on [docs.reactioncommerce.com](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/)

The Reaction documentation source is located in the [reaction-docs](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-docs) repository, while the documentation site is the [reactioncommerce/redoc](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/redoc) application.

## Status

Reaction is expected to have a stable codebase ready for some production configurations within the next couple of major releases. Be aware though, that we're updating frequently. Even existing structures that are functionally done are getting frequent updates to ensure we're current with the most current libraries available to us.

Currently good for contributing, observing progress, and testing. We'd encourage due diligence in production usage, be very comfortable with the code, and risk tolerant. There are still many parts in development!

- Master ( [stable](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/tree/master) )
- Development ( [latest](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/tree/development) )
