Reaction is a modern reactive, real-time event driven ecommerce platform.

Reaction is built with JavaScript, Meteor, Node.js and works nicely with Docker.

See: [Atmosphere Packages for Reaction](https://atmospherejs.com/?q=reactioncommerce)

## Status
- 0.9.0 Master (beta 1)
- 0.10.0 Development
- 0.11.0 Next Stable Release

Currently good for contributing/observing progress, testing. It goes without saying that we're constantly refactoring, even things that are functionally done. We do not recommend using for production usage yet, unless you are very comfortable with the code, and aren't risk averse. There are still many parts in development!

## Installation

```
Node.js and NPM are required. Install from http://nodejs.org/
```

To install Meteor + Reaction, and start the latest release:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
git clone https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction.git
cd reaction && git checkout master
meteor
```

Additional installation options are in the [developer documentation](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/blob/development/docs/developer/installation.md).

_Note: for windows installation you also need:_
- OpenSSL x86 ([windows installer](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html))
- Visual Studio 2008 redistributables
- Git + msysGit ([git-for-windows/git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases))
- ImageMagick

A Docker image is available on the [Reaction Commerce Docker Hub ](https://hub.docker.com/r/reactioncommerce/reaction/).
