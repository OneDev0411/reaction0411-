Reaction is an event-driven, real-time reactive commerce platform built with JavaScript (ES6). It plays nicely with npm and Docker, and is based entirely on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

-   Payments
-   Shipping
-   Taxes
-   Discounts

### Contributing

Star us on GitHub, it helps!

If you are interested in participating in the development of Reaction, that's  great! Check out the [issues](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues) page, starting with the [`Pull Requests Encouraged`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apull-requests-encouraged) and [`Verified Reproducible`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Averified-reproducible) labeled issues. If you find something you want to work on, let us know in the issue comments.

If you're interested in a particular [project](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/projects), like [Marketplace](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/projects/9) and you aren’t sure where to begin, feel free to ask a core team member in the corresponding project [forum](https://gitter.im/reactioncommerce/home).

If your contribution doesn't fit with an existing issue, go ahead and [create an issue](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/new) before submitting a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). This will allow the Reaction team to give feedback if necessary.

Pull Requests should:

-   Be very focused in scope. Smaller scopes are easier for us to digest and approve.
-   Note any existing associated issues.
-   Lint and adhere to the [Reaction style guide](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/styleguide).
-   Pass both [acceptance tests and unit testing](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/testing-reaction).

### Testing

Testing is another great way to contribute. If you do discover a bug, [create an issue](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/new) to report it.

Integration tests can be run at the command line with `reaction test`.

### Deployment

We ensure that all releases are deployable as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.  While we don't regularly test other methods of deployment, our community has documented deployment strategies for AWS, [Digital Ocean](https://gist.github.com/jshimko/745ca66748846551692e24c267a56060), and Galaxy.

For an introduction to Docker deployment, [the Reaction deployment guide](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/deploying) has detailed examples. Reaction Commerce also offers a managed deployment platform integrated with the Reaction command line.
