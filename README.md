Reaction is an event-driven, real-time reactive commerce platform built with JavaScript (ES6). It plays nicely with npm and Docker, and is based entirely on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Features

Reaction’s out-of-the-box core features include:

* Drag-and-drop merchandising
* Order processing
* Payments
* Shipping
* Taxes
* Discounts
* Analytics
* Integration with dozens of third-party apps

And, since anything in our codebase can be extended, overwritten, or installed as a package, you may also develop, scale, and customize anything on our platform.

### Deployment

We require that all releases are deployable as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.  Athough we haven't tested out other methods of deployment, our community has documented deployment strategies for [Heroku](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/1363), AWS, [Digital Ocean](https://gist.github.com/jshimko/745ca66748846551692e24c267a56060), and Galaxy.

##### Docker

Docker images are pushed when Reaction sucessfully builds and passes all tests on the `master` or `development` branches. These images are released on [Reaction Commerce Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/reactioncommerce/). There are two images available: [reactioncommerce:prequel](https://hub.docker.com/r/reactioncommerce/prequel/) - the latest `development` image and [reactioncommerce:reaction](https://hub.docker.com/r/reactioncommerce/reaction/), the `master` image.
