Reaction is a modern reactive, real-time event driven ecommerce platform.

Reaction is built with JavaScript (ES6), Meteor, Node.js and works nicely with Docker.

A Reaction installation provides analytics, shipping, payments, taxes, discounts, emails and social network login out of the box. Configuration just requires you to provide service credentials.

## Installation

**_reaction-cli installation_**

```bash
npm install -g reaction-cli
reaction init
cd reaction
reaction
```

Additional prerequisites, setup options and detailed installation documentation can be found in the [installation](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/development/installation) and [configuration documentation](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/development/configuration). Topics covered are Windows installation, setting up the default credentials, installation without `reaction-cli`, and pre-configuring packages.

## Status

Reaction is expected to have a stable codebase ready for some production configurations within the next couple of major releases. Be aware though, that we're updating frequently. Even existing structures that are functionally done are getting frequent updates to ensure we're current with the most current libraries available to us.

Currently good for contributing, observing progress, and testing. We'd encourage due diligence in production usage, be very comfortable with the code, and risk tolerant. There are still many parts in development!

-   Master ( [stable](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/tree/master) )
-   Development ( [latest](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/tree/development) )

### Deployment

We require that all releases are deployable as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

##### Docker

Docker images are pushed when Reaction sucessfully builds and passes all tests on the `master` or `development` branches. These images are released on [Reaction Commerce Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/reactioncommerce/). There are two images available: [reactioncommerce:prequel](https://hub.docker.com/r/reactioncommerce/prequel/) - the latest `development` image and [reactioncommerce:reaction](https://hub.docker.com/r/reactioncommerce/reaction/), the `master` image.
