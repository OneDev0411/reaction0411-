Reaction is a modern reactive, real-time event driven ecommerce platform.

Reaction is built with JavaScript (ES6), Meteor, Node.js and works nicely with Docker.

## Installation

**_reaction-cli installation_**

```bash
npm install -g reaction-cli
reaction init
cd reaction
reaction
```

`reaction -v` provides useful version information you'll need for debugging if you have issues with `reaction`.

[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php) is optional, but required for transforming images for responsive sizing.

**Windows** users should review the [Windows specific installation requirements for Meteor and Reaction](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/development/requirements).

**reaction-cli** also requires a recent version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

You can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to update to the latest version.

```
npm i -g n
n stable
```

Additional setup options, such as how to set the default credentials, installation without `reaction-cli`, and [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) installation can be found in the [installation](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/development/installation) and [configuration documentation](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/development/configuration).

## Status

Reaction is expected to have a stable codebase ready for some production configurations within the next couple of major releases. Be aware though, that we're updating frequently. Even existing structures that are functionally done are getting frequent updates to ensure we're current with the most current libraries available to us.

Currently good for contributing, observing progress, and testing. We'd encourage due diligence in production usage, be very comfortable with the code, and risk tolerant. There are still many parts in development!

### Deployment
We require that all releases are deployable as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.  While we do not actively test or support other methods of deployment, the community has documented deployment strategies for [Heroku](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/1363), AWS, [Digital Ocean](https://gist.github.com/jshimko/745ca66748846551692e24c267a56060) and Galaxy.

##### Docker

Docker images are pushed when Reaction sucessfully builds and passes all tests on the `master` or `development` branches. These images are released on [Reaction Commerce Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/reactioncommerce/). There are two images available: [reactioncommerce:prequel](https://hub.docker.com/r/reactioncommerce/prequel/) - the latest `development` image and [reactioncommerce:reaction](https://hub.docker.com/r/reactioncommerce/reaction/), the `master` image.
