About this package:

'reactioncommerce:core-theme' is the base Reaction Commerce Bootstrap theme. It contains all the LESS files used by the `reactioncommerce:bootstrap-theme` build process to generate custom LESS files in the [Reaction Commerce](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction) application. You do not need to install this package independantly, `reactioncommerce:bootstrap-theme` will install it.

For customization of Reaction, you can edit the files generated by this package, and override anything created here.

#Bootstrap
This package assumes installation of Bootstrap LESS files, and includes additional mixins and variables in the `default` folder. It depends on `nemo64:bootstrap` which you should have added to Reaction.

#Theme Development
You can clone this package to create additional theme packages for Reaction Commerce. There are a number of placeholder files that should be sufficient for theming. See [reactioncommerce:core documentation](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-core/) for instructions on package development.

#package.js
When creating/cloning a new theme, update the package.js `Package.describe`,

    Package.describe({
      name: "<your meteor organization>:<your-theme-package>",
      summary: "<your theme description>",
      version: "1.0.0",
      git: "<your package repo url>"
    });

# Changing Structure
If you add or delete files, run

    ./build-package.sh

This will update the file list in package.js

However, any files that are not already included must also be updated in the `reactioncommerce:bootstrap-theme` `/server/buildtools/module-definitions.js` file, as this defines what files are included for each theme module.

*Note: if you are developing locally, make sure the .build. directory is deleted before running .build-package.sh*
